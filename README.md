# Musical Journey Dashboard

This is a small personal project I started to combine two things I care about: programming and music.  
I recently bought a MIDI keyboard (Arturia KeyLab Essential mk3) and I also play guitar.  
I wanted a simple way to keep track of what I’m learning, log my practice sessions, and store sheet music and guitar tabs in one place.

It’s a side project I’m building while learning more about full-stack development.

## Why
I wanted a small, self-hosted tool to organize my music learning in one place instead of keeping everything in random folders.  
It helps me stay consistent and see my progress while I practice both guitar and piano.
