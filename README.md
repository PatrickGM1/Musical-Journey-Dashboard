# Musical Journey Dashboard

I recently bought a MIDI keyboard (Arturia KeyLab Essential mk3) and, since I also play guitar, I started looking for a simple tool to keep everything in one place — my practice logs, sheet music, tabs, and the songs I’m learning.

I couldn’t really find anything that fit what I wanted, so I decided to build it myself.
It’s a small personal project that combines my love for music and coding, a space to track my progress and stay organized while learning both piano and guitar.
